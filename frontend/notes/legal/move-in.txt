**Steps on how to take advantage of this benefit:**

1. **Call 407-823-2538** or **email [stulegal@ucf.edu](mailto:stulegal@ucf.edu)** to schedule a free consultation.
2. **Before signing a lease**, bring your document to SLS for a **free attorney review.**
3. Discuss important provisions such as **late fees, subleasing policies, pet rules, utilities, and move-out procedures.**
4. **During move-in:**

   * Take **photos of the unit** and **keep inspection forms** for proof of its condition.
   * Document any **defects or damages** immediately.
5. **Throughout your tenancy:**

   * Keep written communication with your landlord (email or certified mail) for any repair or deposit disputes.
   * If issues persist, **schedule a follow-up appointment** with SLS for legal guidance.
6. Consider **purchasing renter’s insurance** to protect your belongings, as landlords are not liable for personal property damage.
