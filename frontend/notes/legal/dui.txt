DUI Legal Support (Pretrial Diversion & Defense Guidance)

**Subcategory specific description:**
UCF **Student Legal Services (SLS)** offers free legal counseling and guidance for students facing **DUI (Driving Under the Influence)** charges or related offenses. The program helps students understand their rights, penalties, and legal options — including eligibility for the **Orange County Pretrial Diversion (PTD) Program**, which can lead to case dismissal upon successful completion. The service aims to prevent long-term academic, financial, and professional consequences from DUI convictions by connecting students with attorneys who can advise on diversion, defense strategies, and university conduct implications.
