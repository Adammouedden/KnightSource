**Steps on how to take advantage of this benefit:**

1. **Visit the UCF Scholarship Search page** or the **A2O Portal** at [https://ucf.academicworks.com](https://ucf.academicworks.com).
2. **Complete the general A2O application** to be automatically considered for hundreds of internal awards.
3. **Search by college or department** for specialized scholarships (e.g., College of Engineering, Rosen College, Nursing, etc.).
4. **Check your email (and Clutter folder)** frequently for scholarship updates from UCF Financial Aid, Academic Works, or A2O.
5. **Apply early** — between January and May is the optimal period for most scholarships.
6. For **external scholarships**, use the vetted databases linked by UCF such as **FastWeb**, **Chegg**, **Unigo**, and **SallieMae**.
7. **Submit private scholarship checks** through the **Self Report Tool** in myUCF and deliver them to Millican Hall 107 for processing.
8. **Avoid scams:** never pay for scholarship searches, disclose banking information, or apply to “guaranteed scholarship” offers.
9. For **appeals or verification requests**, use the **Document and File Upload tool** on the Financial Aid website or contact **[finaid@ucf.edu](mailto:finaid@ucf.edu)**.
