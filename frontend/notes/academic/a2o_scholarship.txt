Scholarships (A2O: Access to Opportunities Portal)

**Subcategory specific description:**
The **UCF A2O (Access to Opportunities)** portal is the university’s centralized scholarship platform that connects students with **hundreds of scholarships** across all UCF colleges and departments. Once students log in with their **UCF NID and password**, they can complete a general application that automatically matches them with scholarships they qualify for—plus additional ones that require essays, resumes, or supporting documents. The portal includes both **UCF Foundation scholarships** (internal) and **external scholarships** available year-round, helping students secure funding for tuition, housing, and academic expenses.

**Financial value students can receive from using this:**

* Students can earn **anywhere from $500 to $5,000+ per scholarship**, depending on the fund.
* Many students qualify for **multiple awards each year**, which can collectively offset **thousands of dollars in tuition and living costs**.
* Some first-generation and need-based scholarships can **cover full tuition gaps** not met by federal aid.

**Exceptions that would prevent users from using this benefit:**

* Students must be **admitted to UCF with a paid seat deposit** or be **currently enrolled** to log in.
* **DACA, TPS, and undocumented students are ineligible** for internal UCF scholarships.
