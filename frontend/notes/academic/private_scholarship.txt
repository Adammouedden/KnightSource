Private Scholarships

**Subcategory specific description:**
The **Private Scholarships** program allows UCF students to report and process scholarships or awards received from **outside organizations** (non-UCF donors, companies, or foundations). Using the **Self Report Private Scholarships tool** on **myUCF**, students can ensure their external funding is properly reflected in their financial aid package and applied toward tuition, housing, or other university costs. This process prevents over-awarding, allows UCF to meet federal and state aid regulations, and ensures timely disbursement of scholarship funds once checks arrive.

**Financial value students can receive from using this:**

* Students can apply **any external scholarship funds** directly toward their UCF tuition and fees.
* This process prevents **loss or delay of thousands of dollars** in aid due to reporting errors or over-award corrections.
* **No service fee** — students retain 100% of their external scholarship funds.
* Priority reporting allows **aid deferments** for tuition, housing, or textbooks, helping students avoid late fees or temporary out-of-pocket payments.

**Exceptions that would prevent users from using this benefit:**

* **Do not report** scholarships from **UCF colleges, Bright Futures, or the Alumni Association** (these are submitted internally).
* **Late reporting** may delay posting of aid, preventing deferments for tuition or housing.
* **Failure to report** can lead to **reduction or cancellation of financial aid** due to exceeding cost-of-attendance limits.
* Federal and state regulations prohibit aid exceeding total financial need or total cost of attendance.

**Steps on how to take advantage of this benefit:**

1. **Log in to myUCF** and open the **Self Report Private Scholarships** tool.
2. **Report all anticipated external scholarships** (include donor name and award amount).
3. Once you receive an **award letter**, submit it using the same tool.
4. When the **scholarship check arrives:**

   * If made payable to **you and UCF**, **sign the back** and deliver it to:
     Office of Student Financial Assistance, Millican Hall Room 107.
   * If mailed directly by the donor, ensure it includes your **full name, UCF ID, and date of birth or SSN**, or attach a **Private Scholarship Payment Submission Form.**
5. For **timely processing**, submit checks within **5–10 business days** of receipt.
6. Report scholarships by **priority dates** for each term:

   * **May 1:** Summer
   * **July 1:** Fall
   * **November 1:** Spring
7. After 5–7 business days, check **myUCF → View Financial Aid** to confirm the scholarship appears as estimated aid.
8. For any donor-requested documentation (e.g., verification letters), email **[sfascholarships@ucf.edu](mailto:sfascholarships@ucf.edu)** with the subject line “Report Private Scholarships – Additional Documents.”
