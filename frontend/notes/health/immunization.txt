**Subcategory name:**
Immunization Compliance

**Subcategory specific description:**
UCF requires all new students—freshmen and transfers—to submit proof of immunizations before course registration. This process ensures compliance with university health standards and protects the campus community from preventable diseases. Immunization verification is managed through **Med+Proctor**, UCF’s online portal for submitting health documentation. Students must upload a completed **UCF Immunization Health History Form**, signed or stamped by a healthcare provider, and their official vaccine records. Once verified, the immunization hold is automatically removed within 1–2 hours, allowing registration to proceed.

**Phone number:**
407-823-2701 (Option 4)
Email: [immunizations@ucf.edu](mailto:immunizations@ucf.edu)
