**Financial value students can receive from using this:**

* **Free:** Viewing records online through the Patient Portal or sending records to another facility.
* **Up to $6 saved** when records are under 5 pages (no charge for short digital copies).
* **Low-cost duplication:** $1.00 per page (first 25) and $0.50 thereafter for mailed copies — substantially cheaper than most outside medical record services.

* Students under 18 require a parent or guardian’s signature for release or treatment consent.
* Incomplete or unsubmitted authorization forms (no confirmation email).
* Lack of initials for sensitive data authorization (HIV, psychiatric, sexual assault, etc.) means those records cannot be released.
* Consent to Discuss form does **not** allow designees to schedule appointments or obtain copies of records.
