Dental Membership Plan

**Subcategory specific description:**
The UCF Student Health Services (SHS) Dental Membership Plan is an affordable, in-house dental program that provides comprehensive preventive and diagnostic care for students without requiring dental insurance. The plan functions as a **direct primary care agreement** between the student and the UCF dental clinic, offering discounted rates on treatments typically covered under general dentistry. It includes cleanings, exams, X-rays, fluoride treatments, and access to smoking cessation classes—all without premiums, deductibles, or claim forms.
