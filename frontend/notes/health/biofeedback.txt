Biofeedback: Relaxation Training Program

**Subcategory specific description:**
The **Biofeedback Assisted Relaxation Training Program** is a **free, one-on-one stress management program** at UCF that helps students reduce stress and improve self-regulation through guided relaxation techniques. Over **six weekly sessions**, students work with a certified counselor to monitor their body’s physiological responses—such as heart rate, muscle tension, and skin temperature—using small sensors connected to a computer. The program teaches effective methods like deep breathing, muscle relaxation, autogenic training, and guided imagery to help students replace stress responses with calm, positive habits that improve both mental and physical health.
